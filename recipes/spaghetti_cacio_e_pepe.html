    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a recipe that we have made in our family for many years--everyone loves it. It's a very basic and easy variation on mac 'n cheese.
        The recipe only needs 5 mins to prepare and 18 minutes to cook and will yield 4 servings.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1.75 cups grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes. Scoop out some of the cooking water and reserve. Drain spaghetti.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and pepper; cook and stir until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add spaghetti and Pecorino Romano cheese. Ladle in 1/2 cup of reserved cooking water; stir until cheese is melted, about 1 minute. Add more cooking water until sauce coats spaghetti, about 1 minute more.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Cook's Notes</h3>
    <p>Substitute butter for the olive oil if preferred. For a thicker or thinner sauce, adjust how much pasta water you add. If you add too much water, add some more cheese.
        I have added other ingredients depending on my main dish to enhance flavors (like pancetta); I always experiment when creating food.
